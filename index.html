        <p class="lead mb-4">One of my great moments that has inspired me to pursue my goal came from my experience from Redlands Swim Camp.  The Camp is a gathering of all the local swimmers to have a better bond with each other, improve on their swimming, and to have a good time. The event began when I was 10 years old and during those years  I didnâ€™t have many friends and always hated going to practice. I couldnâ€™t find any joy in swimming and even had the decision to quit at one point until I joined Camp.  The Counselors in my Group demonstrated great leadership by encouraging me, helping me develop my social skills and to find the joy in swimming.  The long lasting impression of the seniors enabled me to keep swimming and motivated me to work harder to reach my Goal.  My goal was finally achieved when I qualified for the Junior Olympics and it is a memory that I will always cherish.  However, as the years went by and I reached high school, I wanted to give back what helped me the person I am today to the other Kids who might be experiencing the same problems I went through when I was their age.  It inspired me to become a Counselor my Freshman through Senior year and it was where I found my Joy in helping and teaching others. I put my effort into this camp so it can make a positive impact on the younger kids and hopefully in the future, they can influence what they felt to the next generation and continue on this legacy. With my experience in leadership through high school I also enjoyed Mathematics.  I soon realized that I wanted to major in Math to achieve my goal of becoming a Math Professor.  I began to notice that many people around the world struggle at math and are becoming short on math teachers and professors that are needed in a lot of schools. With my joy of helping others and my passion for Math I want to help as many people as I can in this difficult subject.  With my interest in math, I know there are many directions to take.  I want to discover all the different jobs, because I am still unaware of all the different opportunities to go from as a math major. 
During the 2nd semester of my senior year in high school, it was when we had started to learn online.  I feel like no one was prepared and a lot of people, including me, struggled with online learning.  After summer break, I was quite scared about how I was going to adjust into the college environment all online.  However, during my first quarter, I had made it a goal to take advantage of every single opportunity and get a good start in terms of grades.  I feel like I have succeeded maintaining a 3.81 cumulative gpa so far.  Although, I know that things are going to get a lot tougher, adapting to an online environment was not easy.
